# GitHub Pages Assignment

**(10 pts) Assignment Instructions**

- Create your own GitHub profile/ID (appropriate for job or grad school applications)  
- Create a new repo & initialize it with a "readme"   
- Turn your repo into a website  
    - [repo] >> settings >> [scroll to bottom] >> create website from master branch  
    - choose a style template 
    - note the website url  
    - modify content if you like, but it's fine to use filler content provided for now  
- Locate class repo
    - Find "mdbeckman" in GitHub and locate the "GitHub-Practice-184" class repo
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right)
- Add a row in the table below with your information   
    - (2 pts) first & last name  
    - (3 pts) github id  
    - (2 pts) url for GitHub Pages site from your GitHub repo (**NOT** a url to the repo itself)
    - (2 pts) commit your changes and submit pull request   
            - write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Matt Beckmans info to table")  
            - select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."   
            - click green button "Propose file change" & start pull request  
    - (1 pt) check the link works (wrap url in "<" and ">" to activate link on actual website)  
    - (ungraded) pat yourself on the back
    - **Important**: Your entry will NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.

# Linking to other stuff 

**Below is just a demo for future reference (not graded for this assignment)**

In the assignment you learned to make a repo into a webpage and create a GitHub Pages front end for other people to see.  This is a great way to make your work publicly available to share with other people.  This is a good idea for making a portfolio of your work, a personal webpage, etc.  If I wanted to link to a local file in this repo, I could share [this description of my class schedule in Fall 2017 (link)](ClassScheduleActivity.html).  You might have noticed the document `ClassScheduleActivity.html` appears in the repo, so the previous link simply accesses that HTML document.  

Note that you can make private repos with GitHub, so you and collaborators that you invite can access all the functionality of GitHub without revealing your work to the public.  The content of the webpage and all linked content will be visible to the public, but anything else in the repo will still be private.  I do this with course materials.  For example, my class webpage for STAT 184 is publicly available <https://mdbeckman.github.io/PSU-STAT-184/>, but I keep the repo itself private so I can control what content I do/don't want people to see.
