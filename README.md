# GitHub Pages Assignment

**(10 pts) Assignment Instructions**

- Create your own GitHub profile/ID (appropriate for job or grad school applications)  
- Create a new repo & initialize it with a "readme"   
- Turn your repo into a website  
    - [repo] >> settings >> [scroll to bottom] >> create website from master branch  
    - choose a style template 
    - note the website url  
    - modify content if you like, but it's fine to use filler content provided for now  
- Locate class repo
    - Find "mdbeckman" in GitHub and locate the "GitHub-Practice-184" class repo
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right)
- **Add a row** in the table below with your information 
    - follow the pattern for the vertical bar character (found next to the "]" key)... use the "Matthew Beckman" row as a template
    - (2 pts) first & last name  
    - (1 pt)  class day and time
    - (2 pts) github id  
    - (2 pts) url for GitHub Pages website generated from your GitHub repo  
            - by default it will include "[userID].github.io" at the beginning  
            - it's **NOT** just the URL of the source repo itself  
    - (2 pts) commit your changes and submit pull request   
            - write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Matt Beckman to class table")  
            - click green button "Propose file change" & start pull request  
    - (1 pt) make sure the link works (e.g., wrap url in "<" and ">" to activate link on actual website)  
    - (ungraded) pat yourself on the back
    - **Important**: Your entry will NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
