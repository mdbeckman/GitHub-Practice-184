# GitHub Profile README Assignment

**(10 pts) Assignment Instructions**

*Go slowly, follow the instructions carefully, and you'll be fine!*

1. Create your own GitHub profile/ID (appropriate for job or grad school applications)  
2. Create a new repository with Repository name the same as your GitHub ID (If your GitHub ID contains any capital letters, please change them all to small letters when naming the repository). For e.g. My Github ID is "Soumya-Mukherjee-stat" (without quotes), so my repository name will be "soumya-mukherjee-stat" (without quotes).
3. Give a short Description such as "Github page for First_name Last_name".
4. Initialize it with a "README". (Ignore the .gitignore and license options for the time being)
5. Edit the README.md file by adding a line of text below the "### Hi There " line (could be something like- This is a demo webpage created for Github Practice STAT 184). In the future, you can change this README to a proper introduction to your GitHub profile.
6. Commit the change by clicking the green button "Commit changes" (somewhere along the top right of the page) along with a description of the commit (such as "Added a line of text to the README").
7. Copy the url of the repository you just created (The url should look something like "https://github.com/YourUsername/yourusername").
8. Go to Soumya Mukherjee's GitHub-Practice-184 repo (that generated this page, link https://github.com/Soumya-Mukherjee-stat/GitHub-Practice-184)  
    - There's a "View on GitHub" button somewhere on this page, or you can just search GitHub for "Soumya-Mukherjee-stat" and find the repo named "GitHub-Practice-Repo"
    - "Fork" Soumya Mukherjee's class repo to create your own copy to edit
    - Your copy of the repo should say "[your-userID] / GitHub-Practice-184" at the top with a tiny note saying it was forked from `Soumya-Mukherjee-stat`
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right) to edit your copy of the repo
9. **Add a row** in your copy of the table below with your information 
    - follow the pattern for the vertical bar character (a few keys to the right of "P")... use the "Soumya Mukherjee" row as a template
    - (2 pts) first & last name  
    - (2 pt)  class section
    - (2 pts) github id  
    - (2 pts) url for GitHub Profile repository generated from your new GitHub repo (The url you copied in Step 7)
    - (2 pts) commit your changes and submit pull request
        - write a descriptive commit message (e.g. "added Soumya Mukherjee to class table")
        - click green button "Commit changes"

10. Merge your updated copy of the repo with Soumya Mukherjee's repo...
    - [top of page] >> click "Pull requests" >> click green button "New Pull Request"
    - GitHub will take you to MY (Soumya Mukherjee's) copy of the repo (Soumya-Mukherjee-stat/GitHub-Practice-184) at the top
    - Click the green button "Create pull request"
    - Describe the change again (e.g. "added Soumya Mukherjee to class table")
    - Click the green button "Create pull request"
    - Job done!
11. (ungraded) pat yourself on the back
 
**Important**: Your entry may NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
