# GitHub Pages Assignment

**(10 pts) Assignment Instructions**

- Create your own GitHub profile/ID (appropriate for job or grad school applications)  
- Create a new repo & initialize it with a "readme"   
- Turn your repo into a website  
    - [repo] >> settings >> [scroll to bottom] >> create website from master branch  
    - choose a style template 
    - note the website url  
    - modify content if you like, but it's fine to use filler content provided for now  
- Locate class repo
    - Find "mdbeckman" in GitHub and locate the "GitHub-Practice-184" class repo
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right)
- Add a row in the table below with your information   
    - (2 pts) first & last name  
    - (3 pts) github id  
    - (2 pts) url for GitHub Pages site from your GitHub repo (**NOT** a url to the repo itself)
    - (2 pts) commit your changes and submit pull request   
            - write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Matt Beckmans info to table")  
            - select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."   
            - click green button "Propose file change" & start pull request  
    - (1 pt) use "preview changes" to check that the link works (wrap url in "<" and ">" to activate link on actual website)  
    - (ungraded) pat yourself on the back
    - **Important**: Your entry will NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
