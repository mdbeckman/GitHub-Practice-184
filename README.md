# GitHub Pages Assignment

**(10 pts) Assignment Instructions**

*Go slowly, follow the instructions carefully, and you'll be fine!*

1. Create your own GitHub profile/ID (appropriate for job or grad school applications)  
2. Create a new repo & initialize it with a "README" 
3. Next, let's turn your repo into a website (!)  
    - [repo] >> settings >> [scroll to bottom] >> GitHub Pages ... select "main" branch (i.e., "/ (root)" ) and **SAVE**
    - note your website url "Your site is ready to be published at `https://userid.github.io/repo-name/`"
    - [repo] >> settings >> [scroll to bottom] >> Theme Chooser ... choose the best theme
    - Our friends at GitHub automatically update your README to show off the new theme (thanks GitHub!) 
    - scroll through it and **Commit Changes** at the bottom
4. Go to Dr. Beckman's GitHub-Practice-184 repo (that generated this page)  
    - There's a "View on GitHub" button somewhere on this page, or you can just search GitHub for "mdbeckman" and find the repo
    - "Fork" Dr. Beckman's class repo to create your own copy to edit
    - Your copy of the repo should say "[your-userID/GitHub-Practice-184]" at the top with a tiny note saying it was forked from Dr. Beckman's repo
    - Click on "README.md" >> Edit (pencil icon in upper right) to edit your copy of the repo
5. **Add a row** in your copy of the table below with your information 
    - follow the pattern for the vertical bar character (a few keys to the right of "P")... use the "Matthew Beckman" row as a template
    - (2 pts) first & last name  
    - (1 pt)  class section
    - (2 pts) github id  
    - (2 pts) url for GitHub Pages website generated from **your** new GitHub repo  
            - *Tip*: by default it's something like "[your-userID].github.io/[your-repo-name]"   
            - *Warning*: it's **NOT** just the URL of the source repo itself, which would begin with "github.com/[userid]..."   
    - (2 pts) commit your changes and submit pull request   
            - write a **descriptive** commit message (e.g. "added Matt Beckman to class table")  
            - click green button "Commit changes" 
    - (1 pt) make sure the link works (e.g., wrap url in "<" and ">" to activate link on actual website)  
6. Merge your updated copy of the repo with Dr. Beckman's repo...
    - [top of page] >> click "Pull requests" >> click green button "New Pull Request"
    - GitHub will take you to MY (Dr. Beckman's) copy of the repo (mdbeckman / GitHub-Practice-184) at the top
    - Click the green button "Create pull request"
    - Describe the change again (e.g. "added Matt Beckman to class table")
    - Click the green button "Create pull request"
    - Job done!
7. (ungraded) pat yourself on the back
 
**Important**: Your entry may NOT appear on the class table right away.  Once you submit the "pull request" the owner of the repo (me) needs to approve and merge it into the "master" before your entry will appear in the class table on the website.
